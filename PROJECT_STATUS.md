## How to Launch Your Claude Team

### For Each Claude Instance:

#### Claude 1 (Orchestrator - You)
1. Open new terminal/Claude session
2. Navigate to: `/Users/tyler/artrio`
3. Share: `ORCHESTRATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. You'll coordinate the other Claudes and merge their work

#### Claude 2 (Frontend)
1. Open new terminal/Claude session
2. Navigate to: `/Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/frontend`
3. Share: `FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Let them start working on UI/UX improvements

#### Claude 3 (Backend)
1. Open new terminal/Claude session
2. Navigate to: `/Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/backend`
3. Share: `BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Let them work on Supabase and API optimization

#### Claude 4 (Mobile)
1. Open new terminal/Claude session
2. Navigate to: `/Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/mobile`
3. Share: `MOBILE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Let them handle iOS build preparation

## Quick Start Commands

### For Orchestrator (You):
```bash
cd /Users/tyler/artrio
git fetch --all
git worktree list  # See all worktrees
```

### For Frontend Claude:
```bash
cd /Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For Backend Claude:
```bash
cd /Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/backend
npm install
# Check Supabase configuration
```

### For Mobile Claude:
```bash
cd /Users/tyler/artrio-worktrees/mobile
npm install
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

## Communication Protocol

Each Claude should report status using this format:

```
[ROLE -> ORCHESTRATOR]
Completed: [What's done]
In Progress: [Current work]
Blockers: [Any issues]
PR Ready: YES/NO
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Launch all 4 Claude instances
   - Each Claude reads their instructions
   - Begin initial assessment of current state
   - Frontend starts UI polish
   - Backend checks Supabase setup
   - Mobile prepares iOS project

2. **Day 1 Goals**:
   - Complete initial assessment
   - Fix any critical bugs
   - Set up development environment
   - Create first PRs

3. **Week 1 Target**:
   - Core features polished
   - iOS build working
   - Internal TestFlight build
   - Initial testing complete

## Important Notes

- All instruction files are saved in Dropbox at `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/`
- Each Claude works in their own git worktree (no conflicts!)
- You (Orchestrator) merge changes from the dev branches into main
- Use the TESTFLIGHT_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md to track overall progress

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All 4 Claudes working efficiently
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Daily progress on TestFlight checklist
- [ ] Build uploaded within 1 week
- [ ] Positive feedback from beta testers
