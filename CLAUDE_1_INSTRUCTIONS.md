## ðŸŽ® NEW PRIORITY TASK: Gamification Backend

### Implement Sharing Score & Streak System Backend

You need to create the backend infrastructure for engagement features:

#### 1. Database Schema
Create migrations for:
- `sharing_scores` table (track user sharing points)
- `sharing_events` table (log all sharing activities)
- `user_streaks` table (track daily posting streaks)
- `streak_milestones` table (achievement tracking)

#### 2. Point Calculation System
Implement logic for:
- Award points for sending invites (+10)
- Award points for accepted invites (+50)
- Award points when friends join Trios (+100)
- Daily share bonus (+5, max 1/day)
- Milestone bonuses (5, 10, 25, 50 invites)

#### 3. Streak Tracking Logic
Build system to:
- Track daily posts in Trios
- Calculate current streak
- Handle timezone considerations
- Implement freeze tokens (1/week)
- Grace period (2 hours after midnight)

#### 4. API Endpoints
Create endpoints for:
- GET /api/users/:id/sharing-score (PRIVATE - only accessible by the user themselves)
- GET /api/users/:id/streak (PUBLIC - anyone can see anyone's streak)
- POST /api/sharing-events
- GET /api/users/me/stats (personal stats - points visible only to self)
- GET /api/users/:id/public-profile (returns streak but NOT points)
- PUT /api/streaks/freeze
- NO PUBLIC LEADERBOARD ENDPOINTS

#### 5. Background Jobs
Set up:
- Daily streak checker (cron job)
- Personal milestone tracker
- Notification triggers for streak warnings

See GAMIFICATION_FEATURES.md for full specifications.

**Priority**: This is HIGH PRIORITY - users need reasons to engage daily!
