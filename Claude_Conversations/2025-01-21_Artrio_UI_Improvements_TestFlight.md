## Problems Solved:

### 1. **Messages Layout Squishing**
- Fixed header and input field getting compressed when scrolling
- Changed from flex to absolute positioning with proper z-index

### 2. **Comment on Own Posts**
- Removed restriction preventing users from commenting on their own trio posts
- Users can now engage with their own content

### 3. **Comment Button Issues**
- Fixed button jumping when clicked
- Changed from absolute to flex positioning
- Fixed hover color inconsistency

### 4. **Delete Functionality**
- Implemented swipe-to-delete for posts and comments
- Created consistent rounded delete buttons with trash icons
- Fixed z-index layering for swipe gestures

### 5. **Dropdown Menu System**
- Replaced comment button with 3-dot menu
- Added Edit, Delete, Comment options
- Fixed transparency (95% opacity with backdrop blur)
- **Killed falling animations** with aggressive CSS overrides

### 6. **Multiple Comments**
- Removed `userHasReplied` check that was disabling comments after one
- Users can now comment multiple times on any post

### 7. **Image Upload Issue (Partial Fix)**
- Identified RLS policy blocking media uploads
- Created SQL scripts to fix:
  - `/supabase/fix_post_rate_limit.sql`
  - `/supabase/fix_posts_rls.sql`
  - `/supabase/add_media_columns.sql`
  - `/supabase/diagnose_posts_table.sql`
- Discovered media_url and media_type columns exist but have permission issues
- Provided nuclear option to disable RLS temporarily

## Key Decisions Made:
- Use dropdown menu instead of visible buttons for cleaner UI
- Allow multiple comments per post for better engagement
- Aggressively kill all animations on dropdowns to prevent "falling from sky"
- Created comprehensive SQL fixes for production database issues

## Code/Changes Implemented:
- Complete dropdown menu system with Edit/Delete/Comment
- Swipe-to-delete gestures for mobile
- Fixed all animation issues with CSS overrides
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Created multiple SQL migration scripts

## Tools/Resources Configured:
- Xcode auto-rebuild workflow documented
- SQL scripts for Supabase RLS fixes
- Debug logging for media uploads

## Next Steps:
1. **Run SQL fixes in Supabase to enable image uploads**
2. Monitor TestFlight feedback
3. Consider re-enabling RLS with proper policies after testing
4. Address any issues reported by TestFlight testers

## Outstanding Items:
- Image uploads blocked by RLS (SQL fixes ready to run)
- Need to properly configure posts table permissions in production

## Deployment Status:
âœ… **Successfully submitted to TestFlight for review**
- All UI improvements included
- Multiple comments enabled
- Dropdown menus working
- Animations fixed
