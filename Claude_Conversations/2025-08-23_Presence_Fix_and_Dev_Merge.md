**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Focus:** Fixed online/offline presence indicators and merged Toby's dev branch

## Files Referenced/Used:
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/hooks/usePresence.ts`
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Friends.tsx`
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Messages.tsx`
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/components/SwipeableConversationItem.tsx`
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/components/ClickableAvatar.tsx`
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Various SQL diagnostic files (moved to sql_archive/)

## Files Modified:
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Friends.tsx` - Added presence indicators and real-time updates
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/components/SwipeableConversationItem.tsx` - Added direct database presence fetching
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` - Created for SQL management protocol
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/sql_archive/` - Created and moved all SQL files here

## Problems Solved:

### 1. Presence Not Working After Supabase Upgrade
- **Issue:** Online/offline indicators stopped working after upgrading from Free to Pro tier
- **Root Cause:** Supabase Pro disabled realtime by default for performance
- **Solution:** 
  - Realtime was already re-enabled in Supabase dashboard
  - Applied `APPLY_PRESENCE_FIX_NOW.sql` to fix presence columns and policies
  - Fixed presence indicators across all pages

### 2. Friends Page Missing Presence
- **Issue:** Friends page didn't show online status dots
- **Solution:** Added green dot indicators to Friends list with real-time subscription

### 3. Conversation List Missing Presence  
- **Issue:** Messages page conversation list didn't show online status
- **Solution:** Modified SwipeableConversationItem to directly fetch presence from database with 10-second updates

### 4. SQL File Clutter
- **Issue:** Too many SQL files cluttering main directory
- **Solution:** Created sql_archive/ folder and PROJECT_MEMORY.md with clean-up protocol

### 5. Dev Branch Merge
- **Issue:** Needed to carefully merge Toby's dev branch changes
- **Solution:** 
  - Created backup branch before merge
  - Verified no conflicts with presence work
  - Successfully merged admin features and phone number support
  - Tested build and pushed to main

## Key Decisions Made:
1. Use direct database queries for conversation presence (more reliable than complex hook)
2. Archive SQL files after use to keep directory clean
3. Create PROJECT_MEMORY.md for ongoing protocols
4. Merge dev branch without conflicts - admin features are compartmentalized

## Code/Changes Implemented:
- Enhanced Friends page with presence indicators and real-time updates
- Modified conversation list to fetch presence directly from database
- Set up 10-second refresh for conversation presence status
- Created sql_archive/ folder structure with README
- Merged Toby's admin features and phone number debugging

## Tools/Resources Configured:
- Supabase Realtime (was disabled after upgrade, now re-enabled)
- SQL archive system for organization
- PROJECT_MEMORY.md for ongoing protocols

## Next Steps:
1. Monitor Railway deployment of merged changes
2. Verify presence continues working with Toby's changes
3. Keep SQL files organized in archive
4. Continue following PROJECT_MEMORY protocols

## Outstanding Items:
- Other Claude working on posts table schema issue (leave alone)
- Presence system now fully functional across app
- Dev branch successfully merged to main
