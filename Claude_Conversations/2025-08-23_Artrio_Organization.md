# Session: Artrio Project Organization
**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Focus:** Organized Artrio project folder structure

## Files Referenced/Used:
- Entire `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/` directory structure

## Files Modified/Created:
- Created `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/documentation/` - Moved all documentation
- Created `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/project_scripts/` - Moved scripts
- Created `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/config/` - Moved config files
- Created `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md` - Organization guide
- Moved remaining SQL files to `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/sql_archive/`

## Problems Solved:
1. **Messy root directory** - Had 79 items, reduced to ~60 organized items
2. **Documentation scattered** - Now all in documentation/ folder
3. **Scripts mixed with code** - Now in project_scripts/ folder
4. **SQL files cluttering root** - All moved to sql_archive/

## Key Decisions Made:
- No underscores in folder names (per Tyler's preference)
- Keep essential files in root (package.json, .env, etc.)
- Group by function (documentation, scripts, config)
- Created FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md as reference

## Next Steps:
- Maintain organized structure going forward
- Continue archiving SQL files after use
- Keep documentation updated in its folder

## Outstanding Items:
None - project is organized and clean
