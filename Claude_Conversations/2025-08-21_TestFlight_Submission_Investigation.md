### Files Modified
1. **~/.gmail-mcp/setup-instructions.md** - Created Gmail MCP setup guide
2. **~/.claude.json** - Added Gmail MCP server configuration
3. **Xcode rebuild** - Performed full rebuild and reinstall on Tyler's iPhone

### Key Problems Solved
1. ✅ Clarified TestFlight submission status confusion
2. ✅ Identified missing Apple confirmation emails as potential issue
3. ✅ Set up Gmail MCP for both email accounts
4. ✅ Rebuilt and reinstalled app on iPhone (Xcode mode)

### Important Findings

#### TestFlight Status Analysis
- **Build 1755739542** shows "Waiting for Review" (NOT "Prepare for Submission")
- Binary State: Validated ✅
- Upload Date: Aug 21, 2025 at 2:46 AM ✅
- 90-day expiration timer running ✅
- BT (Beta Testing) groups assigned ✅

#### Evidence of Submission
1. "Waiting for Review" = Submitted to Apple's queue
2. "Prepare for Submission" = Not submitted yet
3. Binary validation completed
4. Upload timestamp present

#### Missing Email Issue
- NO confirmation emails received at tylerszakacs@gmail.com
- This is UNUSUAL - should have received:
  - "Build Uploaded" notification
  - "Build Processing Complete" notification
  - "Waiting for Review" confirmation
- Possible causes:
  - Email notifications disabled in App Store Connect
  - Emails in spam/promotions folder
  - Submission incomplete despite status

### Tools/Resources Configured
- **Gmail MCP Server** installed: `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`
- Added to Claude configuration for future email access
- Will be available after Claude restart

### Next Steps
1. **CHECK EMAILS IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Search tylerszakacs@gmail.com for: `from:noreply@email.apple.com`
   - Check spam, promotions, updates tabs
   - Search for "Artrio", "TestFlight", "App Store Connect"

2. **If NO emails found**:
   - Go to App Store Connect
   - Check for "Submit for Review" button
   - May need final submission step

3. **Verify notification settings**:
   - App Store Connect > Profile > Email Notifications
   - Ensure TestFlight notifications are enabled

4. **After Claude restart**:
   - Gmail MCP will be available for direct email searching
   - Can monitor both accounts automatically

### Critical Action Items
- **VERIFY SUBMISSION**: Missing emails suggest possible incomplete submission
- **Expected timeline**: 24-48 hours for TestFlight review (if properly submitted)
- **Monitor**: App Store Connect for status changes

### Session Conclusion
TestFlight submission shows correct status but missing confirmation emails is concerning. Need to verify actual submission state and ensure email notifications are properly configured. Gmail MCP now installed for future email monitoring capabilities.
