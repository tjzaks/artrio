# Artrio - Toby's Features Integration
**Date:** January 19, 2025
**Topic:** Merging Toby's dev branch improvements into main

## Context
This session was a continuation from a previous conversation about the Artrio social media app where we had run out of context. The previous work included messaging fixes, UI improvements, and notification badge implementation.

## Files Modified
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/components/ClickableAvatar.tsx` - Created new component
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Added real-time subscriptions and replaced Avatar components
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Messages.tsx` - Replaced Avatar with ClickableAvatar
- `/Users/tyler/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/artrio/src/pages/Friends.tsx` - Replaced Avatar with ClickableAvatar

## Problems Solved

### 1. Analyzed and Integrated Toby's Dev Branch Features
- Tyler requested careful analysis of Toby's work on the dev branch
- Needed to verify quality and ensure no conflicts with existing work
- Successfully identified key improvements:
  - Clickable avatars for profile navigation
  - Real-time trio formation updates
  - Real-time queue status updates
  - Enhanced queue join responses

### 2. Implemented ClickableAvatar Component
- Created reusable component for consistent user profile navigation
- Features:
  - Navigate to user profile on click
  - Hover effects with ring and scale
  - Multiple size options (sm/md/lg)
  - Fallback to username initials when no avatar

### 3. Added Real-time Trio Formation
- Implemented `subscribeToTrioUpdates()` function
- Listen for new trio creation events
- Auto-refresh UI when user's trio is formed
- Show celebration toast with gradient styling
- Auto-scroll to trio section after formation

### 4. Enhanced Queue Management
- Added `subscribeToQueueUpdates()` for live queue changes
- Improved `joinQueue()` response handling:
  - `trio_created` - Full trio with celebration
  - `duo_created` - Partial trio notification
  - `queued` - Simple queue join with position
- Better UX with contextual messages

### 5. Restored Notification System
- Re-enabled notification badges for messages and friend requests
- Fixed `fetchNotificationCounts()` to properly count unread messages
- Added immediate badge clearing when accessing messages
- Maintained proper notification state management

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Careful Implementation Over Direct Merge**
   - Instead of forcing a merge with conflicts, implemented features individually
   - Preserved all existing iOS fixes and disabled notifications
   - Ensured no regression of previous work

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Created ClickableAvatar as a standalone component for reusability
   - Replaced Avatar components systematically across all pages
   - Maintained consistent user interaction patterns

3. **Real-time Features**
   - Added Supabase channel subscriptions for trio and queue updates
   - Proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
   - Enhanced user feedback with toast notifications

## Code Implementation Highlights

### ClickableAvatar Component
```typescript
export default function ClickableAvatar({ 
  userId, username, avatarUrl, size = 'md', className, showHoverEffect = true
}: ClickableAvatarProps) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const handleClick = () => navigate(`/user/${userId}`);
  return (
    <Avatar className={cn(sizeClasses[size], 'cursor-pointer transition-all duration-200', ...)} 
            onClick={handleClick}>
      <AvatarImage src={avatarUrl || undefined} />
      <AvatarFallback>{username.substring(0, 2).toUpperCase()}</AvatarFallback>
    </Avatar>
  );
}
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
```typescript
const subscribeToTrioUpdates = () => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel('trio_updates')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'trios',
      filter: `date=eq.${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`
    }, async (payload) => {
      // Check if user is in new trio and update UI
    })
    .subscribe();
  return () => supabase.removeChannel(channel);
};
```

## Tools/Resources Configured
- Git branch management (main, dev, toby-merge branches)
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Railway automatic deployment from main branch
- npm build and test processes

## Next Steps
- ✅ All features successfully integrated and deployed
- ✅ Railway auto-deployment triggered (2-3 minutes)
- Monitor real-time features in production
- Consider performance optimizations for subscriptions
- Potential code splitting for bundle size optimization

## Outstanding Items
None - all requested features have been successfully implemented and deployed.

## Deployment Status
- Changes committed to main branch with message: "Re-enable notification badges and fix fetchNotificationCounts"
- Railway automatic deployment completed
- Live at: artrio.up.railway.app
