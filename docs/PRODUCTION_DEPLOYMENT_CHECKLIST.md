## 🚨 Critical Actions Before Production

### Immediate (Must do before launch):
1. **Rotate API Keys**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase Dashboard:
   # 1. Go to Settings > API
   # 2. Generate new anon and service keys
   # 3. Update .env file with new keys
   # 4. Update Railway environment variables
   ```

2. **Run Security SQL Scripts**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   -- 1. secure_admin_functions.sql
   -- 2. create_error_logs_table.sql
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Railway Dashboard, set:
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_new_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key
   ```

4. **Enable Supabase Security Features**
   - [ ] Enable Row Level Security on all tables
   - [ ] Enable SSL enforcement
   - [ ] Configure CORS properly
   - [ ] Set up rate limiting in Supabase

5. **Test Critical Paths**
   - [ ] User registration flow
   - [ ] Login/logout
   - [ ] Trio creation
   - [ ] Admin functions (with admin account only)
   - [ ] Health check endpoint

## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set up
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry) configured

### Security
- [ ] All environment variables set in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] RLS policies verified
- [ ] Admin accounts properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting tested under load

### Performance
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Database indexes optimized
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented
- [ ] Image/video optimization configured

### Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Privacy policy updated
- [ ] Terms of service finalized
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified
- [ ] Cookie consent implemented
- [ ] Data retention policies configured

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Current Data**
   ```bash
   # Export current database
   pg_dump [connection_string] > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Code**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production security fixes and monitoring"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```sql
   -- In order:
   1. secure_admin_functions.sql
   2. create_error_logs_table.sql
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check /health endpoint
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify admin panel (with admin account)
   - Check error logging

5. **Monitor Post-Deployment**
   - Watch error logs for first 24 hours
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Check user feedback channels

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] Health check returns "healthy" status
- [ ] No critical errors in first 24 hours
- [ ] Response times < 1 second for key operations
- [ ] Successful user registrations
- [ ] Admin functions working correctly

## 🔧 Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # In Railway:
   # 1. Go to deployments
   # 2. Click on previous stable deployment
   # 3. Click "Rollback to this deployment"
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed)
   ```sql
   -- Restore from backup
   psql [connection_string] < backup_[date].sql
   ```

3. **Communication**
   - [ ] Notify users of temporary downtime
   - [ ] Post status update
   - [ ] Document issues for post-mortem

## 📝 Post-Deployment

- [ ] Remove development/debug code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Schedule security audit
- [ ] Plan performance optimization sprint
- [ ] Set up regular backup verification
