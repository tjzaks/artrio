## Quick Commands

### Tyler's Commands
```bash
# Create task for Toby
"Tell Toby to fix [this thing]"

# Check Toby's work
git diff main..origin/dev

# Merge Toby's fixes
git merge origin/dev && git push

# See Toby's progress
gh issue list --assignee toby
```

### Toby's Commands (to his Claude)
```bash
"Let's start work"          # Setup dev branch
"What are my tasks?"        # List issues
"Work on issue 5"           # Start task
"Rebuild on my phone"       # Test on iPhone
"It works, commit it"       # Push to dev
```

## The Rules

### Tyler (Senior Engineer)
- Works on `main` branch
- Finds bugs, creates issues
- Reviews and merges from `dev`
- Handles complex features

### Toby (Junior Developer)  
- Works on `dev` branch only
- Fixes exactly what issues say
- Tests on real iPhone
- Pushes to dev for review

### Claude (AI Assistants)
- Tyler's Claude: Creates detailed issues, manages workflow
- Toby's Claude: Follows issues exactly, auto-builds for iPhone

## File Structure

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Page components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # Reusable components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hooks/         # Custom React hooks

â””â”€â”€ docs/             # Documentation
```

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Issues completed = progress made
- âœ… All tests pass before commits
- âœ… Dev branch stays clean
- âœ… Main branch stays stable
- âœ… Tyler focuses on hard problems
- âœ… Toby learns by doing safe tasks

## The Magic
1. **No manual Xcode** - Claude auto-builds
2. **No confusion** - Exact instructions
3. **No breaking prod** - Dev branch safety
4. **Real device testing** - iPhone verification
5. **Clear ownership** - Tyler leads, Toby executes
